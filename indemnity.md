**Crypto Theft**. Tokens are stolen by hackers.

**Crypto Scams**. 1) Email phishing. A scammer sends unsolicited emails asking for user’s login details, which can be used to steal tokens. Alternatively, they may offer “prizes” or “rewards” in exchange for a token deposit. 2) Investment scam. A scammer posts fake advertisement which links to a website that fraudulently resembles a legitimate crypto investment trading platform, tricking users into transferring their tokens to the bogus platform to trade.&#x20;

**Crypto Rug Pull:** A rug pull is a malicious maneuver where crypto developers create a token, list it, pair it with a leading cryptocurrency like Ethereum (as an example), and wait until a significant amount of unsuspecting investors swap their ETH for the listed token, they then withdraw everything from the liquidity pool, drive the coin's price to zero, abandon the project and run away with users’ funds.
