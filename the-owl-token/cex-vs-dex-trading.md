# CEX vs DEX Trading

$OWL token has a tax fee on transfer of 10% for its auto-liquidity adding protocol.&#x20;

That means, if you trade on Decentralized Exchanges, you need to pay 10% tax.

If you trade on Centralized Exchanges, the trading itself won't cost any tax fee.&#x20;

If you deposit $OWL to CEX, there will be 10% transfer tax, but after that the trading on CEX costs no transfer fee.&#x20;

As we whitelist CEX hot & cold wallets, withdrawal from CEX to a external Web 3 wallet has no transfer tax either.&#x20;
