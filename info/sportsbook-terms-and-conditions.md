5. MARKETS 5.1. "Match" (1X2) is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) outcome of a match or event. The options are: "1" = Home team, or team listed to the left side of the offer; "X" = Draw, or the selection in the middle; "2" = Away team, or team listed to the right side of the offer.

5.2. "Correct Score" ( is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) exact score of a match or event.

5.3. "Over/Under" (Totals) is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) amount of a predefined occurrence (e.g. goals, points, corners, rebounds, penalty minutes, etc.). Should the total amount of the listed occurrences be exactly equal to the betting line, then all bets on this offer will be declared void. Example: an offer where the betting line is 128.0 points and the match ends with the result 64-64 will be declared void.

5.4. "Odd/Even" is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) amount of a predefined occurrence (e.g. goals, points, corners, rebounds, penalty minutes, etc.)."Odd" is 1,3,5 etc.; "Even" is 0,2,4 etc.

5.5. A "Head-to-Head'' and/or "Triple-Head" is a competition between two or three participants/outcomes, originating from either an officially organised event, or else, as virtually defined by the Sportsbook platform.

5.6. "Half time/Full time" is where it is possible to bet on the result in half time and the final outcome of the match. E.g. if at Half time the score is 1-0 and the match ends 1-1, the winning outcome is 1/X. The bet is void if the regular time of the match is played in a different time format than those listed in the bet (i.e. other than two halves).

5.7. "Period betting" is where it is possible to bet on the outcome of each separate period within a match/event.

5.8. "Draw No Bet" is where it is possible to bet on either "1" or "2" as defined in 5.1. It is also common practice to refer to "Draw No Bet" in cases where no draw odds are offered. Should the specific match contain no winner (E.g. match ends as a draw), or the particular occurrence does not happen (E.g. Draw No Bet and match ends 0-0) the stakes will be refunded.

5.9. "Handicap" is where it is possible to bet on whether the chosen outcome will be victorious once the listed handicap is added/subtracted (as applicable) to the match/period/total score to which the bet refers to. In those circumstances where the result after the adjustment of the handicap line is exactly equal to the betting line, then all bets on this offer will be declared void. Example: a bet on -3.0 goals will be declared void if the team chosen wins the match by exactly 3 goals difference (3-0,4-1, 5-2, etc).

Asian Handicap: Home team (-1.75) vs Away team (+1.75). This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets and placed on the outcomes -1.5 and -2.0. For the bet to be fully paid out at the listed odds, Team A must win the match with a bigger margin than both of their listed handicaps (ie. 3 goals or more margin). In the eventuality that Team A wins with only a 2 goal margin, the bet will be considered as partially won with a full payout on the -1.5 part of the bet and a refund on the -2.0 side since the outcome on that part of the bet would be considered a “tie”. Should the match produce any other outcome, including a Team A victory with only 1 goal margin, the whole stake would be lost. Away teams are given a +1.75 goal advantage in the match. This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets and placed on the outcomes +1.5 and +2.0.

A tackle lost is where a tackle is made but the ball goes to an opposition player.
