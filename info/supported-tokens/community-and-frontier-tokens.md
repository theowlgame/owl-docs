# Community and Frontier Tokens

### Token Types

Tokens are categorized as core tokens, community tokens and 'frontier' tokens. You can check the token type next to the your wallet balance in the header.&#x20;

Core tokens are mainstream tokens such as BTC, ETH, BNB, Matic, FTM and stablecoins.&#x20;

We also list tokens from other DEFI projects too so more people can try our games with their preferred tokens. These are community tokens and Frontier tokens.&#x20;

For tokens whose liquidity is sufficient enough to maintain a stable price, they will be categorized as community token.

For tokens whose liquidity is small, price is wild, they will be categorized as 'frontier' tokens.  Most meme tokens, which tend to rugs easily, fall in this category.&#x20;

### Price Factor

Core tokens have the maximum price factor, which equals to 1. Community tokens usually have smaller price factors. Frontier tokens have smallest price factor. Price factors only affect the $ value you see in 3rd-party games. To understand more, check [understanding-price-factor.md](understanding-price-factor.md "mention")

### Withdrawal Limits, Bet Limits
