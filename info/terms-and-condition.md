If a player for example deposits €50, has a loss limit of €10 and the player goes on and wins €1,000, the player can still lose more than €10 of the €1,000 balance as it's based on the initial deposit instead of the winnings.

If you’ve withdrawn more funds than what you have deposited, we’ll pay out any additional amounts via another payment option.

Prior to any amounts being processed, all bonuses and winnings in your balance will be removed prior to calculation of the refund amount. If it’s the case where any credit card purchases are deemed to carry a bigger than necessary risk for security or legal reasons, by your payment processor or the casino, we will initiate refunds of the transactions in questions back to the card, and notify the appropriate authorities and parties.
