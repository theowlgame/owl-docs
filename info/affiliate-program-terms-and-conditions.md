The actual Casino NGR from player activity per month will be calculated into USDT value according to the realtime price on first day of next month. During the month, the estimated NGR might fluctuate due to changing coin prices.

up to $10k a Month : 15%&#x20;

$10k to $20k a Month : 20%&#x20;

$20k to $30k a Month : 25%&#x20;

Your affiliate earnings are personal to you and you shall have no claim to affiliate earnings or other compensation on business secured by or through persons or entities other than you. You cannot withdraw payments for or on behalf of another third party.

COMPANY reserves the right to change any affiliate earnings structure (or any part thereof) from time to time, for any reason it deems fit.

All affiliate earnings payments will be paid to your affiliate account designated in your affiliate sign up form in the currency of our choice. Payment will be made by cryptocurrencies, player account transfer, or any other method as we in our sole discretion decide; however, we will use reasonable endeavors to accommodate your preferred payment method.

Affiliate needs at least 25 depositing players (active) before their commission is paid each month.&#x20;

Minimum withdrawals for affiliates is $100 or equivalent tokens. Should you have earned a lesser amount, the money will remain pending in the system until you have collected enough money for us to process the cashout.

Any charges for conversion, processing and delivering payment to you will be deducted from your affiliate earnings. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no liability to pay any currency conversion charges or any charges associated with the transfer of monies to your designated account.

Further, deposit of payment check, acceptance of payment transfer or acceptance of other payment from us by you will be deemed full and final settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any overpayment is made in the calculation of your affiliate earnings, we reserve the right to correct such calculation at any time and to reclaim from you any overpayment made by us to you.

Payment shall be processed on the 5th of the following month in which the traffic was generated. If we suspect the terms and conditions have been breached or the occurrence of fraud traffic, the payment request may be held over for investigation and your account frozen until we can validate that there has been no breach of these terms and conditions. If your account remains frozen as a consequence of this clause 5.9 for a continuous period of 180 days then in the absence of: satisfactory explanation; or evidence to prove legitimate dealings, funds remaining in your account will be removed and your account closed.

You shall comply with all applicable laws and any policy notified by us through our site or otherwise in relation to money laundering and/or suspicious transactions.

All affiliates shall be responsible for paying such taxes on their affiliate earnings under the laws applicable to them.

If you wish to offer any incentives to potential players, you are required by us to receive prior written approval before commencing any such activity. In the event that you do not receive such approval but offer such incentives, we reserve the right to cancel your participation in the program, and refuse payment of any previously earned, but unpaid, commissions.

There can be negative carryover when it comes to cryptocurrency wagering. All negative amounts from cryptocurrency wagering might be carried over to the following months. Please negotiate the negative carryover terms with your account manager.&#x20;

All affiliate cryptocurrency commissions will be leveled off i.e. if affiliate has negative Bitcoin wagering and positive ETH wagering, negative Bitcoin commission will be deducted from positive ETH commission.

All crypto revenue (ETH, LTC etc.) will be converted to USDT.

Due to strict anti money laundering requirements we might require one or more forms of documentation to verify your identity before we can make a first payment out to you. If for a continuous period of 180 days from our request for this verification documentation, we have still not received the same from you then the funds remaining in your account will become dormant. Upon becoming dormant we will issue a warning advising that the funds remaining in your account will be removed if the necessary verification document is not received within the following 90 days, funds remaining in your account will be removed and your account closed.

### REPORTS&#x20;
