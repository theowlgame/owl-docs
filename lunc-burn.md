# LUNC Burn

Terracasino endeavors to contribute to Terra Classic Community.

### Current Burn Mechanism

Currently, the burn amount is deposit & withdrawal tax for LUNC tokens. The data is updated every 30 mins. This tax is taken (included in transaction cost) automatically by the Terra Classic Network. It adds up all transaction cost (fees) going in/ out from the bankroll wallet address, including failed ones (as failed ones cost gas too). All transactions can be traced via our [bankroll ](https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra1mn3unuuhxt9602v0zwnjum9nmchx4wu846uxsk)wallet address.&#x20;

### More Burn Mechanism Soon

Terracasino will implement more burn mechanism based on casino performance, for example, bet volume.&#x20;
